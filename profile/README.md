## Hi there 👋

☁ The propuse of this organization is to store 'pgmesa' projects that are not completelly finished, coded in a way I don't like nowadays (not structured or I was just learning) or not well documented yet, and maybe never. But if they are here and public is because I think some of them could be used as a base for other projects or as a source of inspiration.
The projects that are not usefull for the community will be private repositories.

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
