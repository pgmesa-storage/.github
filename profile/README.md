## Hi there 👋

☁ The propuse of this organization is to store 'pgmesa' projects that are not completelly finished or not well documented yet and maybe never. 
The projects that are not usefull for the community will be private repositories while the public ones could be used as a base for other projects or a source of inspiration.
<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
